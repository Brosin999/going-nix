# going-nix ‚ùÑÔ∏èüêè

This is the start of my nix journey. It is now my primary OS, which I will incrementally upgrade as I use.

In the future I would like to document this repository so it becomes an un-intimidating starting point for learning / trying all the things you can use Nix for.

But first, I must learn many lessons myself.

Small things:
- [ ] Declarative Partitioning + Impermenance.
- [ ] Home-manager only build (for non-nixos systems)
- [ ] Document directories

Big things that need small starts and some education:
- [ ] Hardening
- [ ] Secrets Management (post quantum algos?)
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Multi-host configuration, build & deployment
